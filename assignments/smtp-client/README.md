# SMTP Client Assignment

We have made two different "clients", with their own respective GUI's.
The two clients and their guides can be found below.

## Web Client

The web client runs using Flask, and can be run from this folder, using Docker with the attached docker-compose.yml file.

**Remember to change the variables in smtp_variables.env.**

## Qt Client

The Qt client is a normal "window" GUI, and can be run using main.py in the pygui folder.

# The SMTP protocols

To make the two client interfaces work, we have made the SMTP calls that the clients can use.
Both can be found in the "smtp" folder in the respective clients, and are exact copies.
