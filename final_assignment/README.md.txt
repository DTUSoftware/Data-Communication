### TA's feedback

#### Assignment 1 - Infographic and Presentation

Our TA gave the feedback orally, and was sick at the time of handing in this final assignment, so he could not provide us with a written version of the feedback. The provided feedback below is as close to his oral feedback as we could remember:

Infographic was good, and easy to understand, and it was nice that it was not a powerpoint presentation, and that it was actually an infographic.

Showed understanding of the subject (DNS), and to questions.


#### Assignment 2 - Programming

Very nice assignment. Shows good understanding of sockets and the smtp protocol. Very nice GUIs you have written too. All extra tasks have been done, although it would have been nice to have been able to show an image in the message body using mime and base64 encoding.

#### Assignment 3 - Configure a router

No feedback required.

### Changelog

#### Assignment 2 - Programming

We have added pictures showing that images are able to be sent in our mails.
It was a part of the code before, but we forgot to include any images of us having done so.
